# Operational_Research_Project_2024
Operational Research Course Project in Python ECE AUTH 2024 , 7th semester.
This project addresses two critical operational research problems related to scheduling and logistics: 
1. Single Runway Landing Scheduling: A scheduling solution for managing landings at a single-runway airport, aiming to minimize operational disruptions by optimizing arrival times within specified windows for each aircraft.

2. Heating Oil Delivery Optimization: A logistics solution for planning efficient delivery routes for heating oil from a central refinery to multiple cities, balancing delivery costs and customer demand.

The project is implemented in Python.
